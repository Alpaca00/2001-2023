# **2001-2023**

This project is a **recreation of my old projects**, updated with **modern technologies**. What once required a significant amount of **HTML, CSS**, and **code** can now be achieved **much more efficiently** with today's tools and frameworks.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **technology has evolved** and how much simpler it is to implement these ideas today.
